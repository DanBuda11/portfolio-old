## Dan Buda's Portfolio

This project is an update to a previous version of my portfolio. While the previous version was functional and looked fine, I wanted to create a new portfolio with a newer version of React and to make use of a custom Webpack framework that I have been developing.

The site is fully responsive and built with a mobile-first mindset.

React (version), Sass with mixins, custom Webpack framework, React Router v4, ES6, rimraf,
Font Awesome, Flexbox, CSS Grid, Webpack

Used Pablo to help create standard size images and TinyPNG to shrink them all down

Webpack v2 framework include hashing code segments, image size limits for faster loading
