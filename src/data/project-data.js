      'I have been involved in real estate in different capacities for over 10 years as both a Realtor and investor. I have been increasingly disappointed by the lack of innovation in real estate technology. While this project is in no way going to reshape the MLS, I hope that it shows that, at least in a relatively simple way with limited functionality, that the digital tools for a Realtor, both in a digital marketing capacity as well as when listing properties for sale or rent, can be simple, useful and powerful. It should also serve as an easy way for a small-scale investor such as myself to have a place to store and advertise the properties I have for rent or sale. This project includes made-from-scratch responsive header and grid system.',

    blurb:
      "This project was done for several professional and personal reasons. Professionally, as a staffer in the Texas Legislature, I wanted to have a quick reference to all of the deadlines during a legislative session, as well as a reminder of when session is about to rear its ugly head and how much time before it's all over. Personally, this was a great project to practice using design tools such as use of white space, flexbox and CSS grid, CSS transitions and gradients. It also gave me a chance to (quite heavily) use the date-fns library to help with all of the date-time calculations needed to make this all work.",
