// Use Pablo to make images
	// Test using both Twiiter-size and square images for all screen sizes,
	// thumbnails and project page.
	// Credit Pablo with link in README

// Make README pretty extensive and don't wait until the end to start writing it

// Before final push to GitHub and final deploy, clean up code really well,
// create as many Sass variables and mixins as possible, clean up Sass to make it
// as small as possible

// Make sure to test CSS breakpoints on all devices, including different computers
// and Susie's phone

// Credit everything I used: Pablo, TinyPNG, Font Awesome, Webpack, rimraf in README

// Create testing and make tests, make sure to include in .gitignore

// Need to fix function that sets last row of projects
// the left. Not working in 2-column view
	// But this is only going to work with a set # of
	// projects. Need a different solution

// For responsive styling, start working with more
// breakpoints and just make changes as neccesary
